        <div style="line-height: 1.4;">
            <p>1. Your trading account has a “Unique Client Code” (UCC), different from your demat account number. Do not allow anyone (including your own stock broker, their representatives and dealers) to trade in your trading account on their own without
                taking specific instruction from you for your trades. Do not share your internet/ mobile trading login credentials with anyone else.</p>
            </br>
            <p>2. You are required to place collaterals as margins with the stock broker before you trade. The collateral can either be in the form of funds transfer into specified stock broker bank accounts or margin pledge of securities from your demat
                account. The bank accounts are listed on the stock broker website. Please do not transfer funds into any other account. The stock broker is not permitted to accept any cash from you.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p>3. The stock broker’s Risk Management Policy provides details about how the trading limits will be given to you, and the tariff sheet provides the charges that the stock broker will levy on you.</p>
            </br>
            <p>4. All securities purchased by you will be transferred to your demat account within one working day of the payout. In case of securities purchased but not fully paid by you, the transfer of the same may be subject to limited period pledge
                i.e. seven trading days after the pay-out (CUSPA pledge) created in favor of the stock broker. You can view your demat account balances directly at the website of the Depositories after creating a login.</p>
            </br>
            <p>5. The stock broker is obligated to deposit all funds received from you with any of the Clearing Corporations duly allocated in your name. The stock broker is further mandated to return excess funds as per applicable norms to you at the time
                of quarterly/ monthly settlement. You can view the amounts allocated to you directly at the website of the Clearing Corporation(s).</p>
            </br>
            <p>6. You will get a contract note from the stock broker within 24 hours of the trade.</p>
            </br>
            <p>7. You may give a one-time Demat Debit and Pledge Instruction (DDPI) authority to your stock broker for limited access to your demat account, including transferring securities, which are sold in your account for pay-in.</p>
            </br>
            <p>8. The stock broker is expected to know your financial status and monitor your accounts accordingly. Do share all financial information (e.g. income, networth, etc.) with the stock broker as and when requested for. Kindly also keep your email
                Id and mobile phone details with the stock broker always updated.</p>
            </br>
            <p>9. In case of disputes with the stock broker, you can raise a grievance on the dedicated investor grievance ID of the stock broker. You can also approach the stock exchanges and/or SEBI directly.</p>
            </br>
            <p>10. Any assured/guaranteed/fixed returns schemes or any other schemes of similar nature are prohibited by law. You will not have any protection/recourse from SEBI/stock exchanges for participation in such schemes.

                    <p>A stock that trades at a relatively low price and market capitalization. These types of stocks are generally considered to be highly speculative and high risk because of their lack of liquidity, large bid-ask spreads, small capitalization

                        for such variation, reduction or imposition or the client's inability to route any order through the stock broker's trading system on account of any such variation, reduction or imposition of limits. The client further agrees that
                        the stock broker may at any time, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, prohibit or restrict the client's ability to place orders or trade in securities through the stock broker, or it may subject any order placed by

facilitate operations and banking convenience, I/We hereby authorize you to maintain my/our fund account with you on a running

margins/exposures/collateral/any other obligations due to you. I/We also understand and agree that any credit amount lying with you will
not attract any interest. I/We further understand that in case of non-payment of dues by me/us upto T+ 2 day, the securities received
towards payout may be retained by you in the Client Unpaid Securities Accounts (CUSA) as per the applicable guidelines.

            <li>

                On my/our specific request, you may release the Funds due to me/us. While doing the settlement, you may retain
Entire pay-in obligation of funds outstanding at the end of the day on settlement of running account, of T day, 50% margin Liability as on

        </li><br>
    <li>
        I/We hereby agree that you will settle my/our account of funds at least once in a quarter/month after considering
